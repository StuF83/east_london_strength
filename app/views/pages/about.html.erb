      <p>
        I’ve been a personal trainer for over 10 years, helping people build strength, confidence, and a sustainable relationship with training that supports their long-term health and wellbeing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I served in the Royal Marines, where fitness wasn’t just part of the job — it was a deeply embedded culture. Since leaving the military, I’ve continued to explore what physical training means in everyday life, and how to share that with others in a way that’s enjoyable, rewarding, and lasting.

      <p>
        My approach is grounded in movement quality — helping you move well, build enough strength to feel capable and resilient, and develop confidence in your own physicality. Most of my work is with people new to strength training, or those looking to reintroduce it into their lives after time away.

        I now coach from Basis Gym in London Fields, Hackney — a fantastic space where we can build a practice that works for you.
