          <p>“I really do look forward to my sessions with Stu. He is one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet, he genuinely cares about his clients and is very supportive. I would highly recommend him to anyone, no matter what area of your health and fitness you wish to improve; whether you are a newbie to exercise or an experience athlete. My sessions with Stu are a highlight of my week; they must be as I travel from South East London to train with him.”</p>

          <p>“I've been training with Stu for over a year now and think he is excellent.
          I really like his calm, encouraging and knowledgable approach.
          Stu's attention to detail and technique tips have got me lifting heavier weights than I even imagined. And he's got a sense of humour which makes sessions fun too. I highly recommend!”</p>

      <h2>Endurance athletes</h2>
      <div class="testi-grid">
        <article class="testi-card">
          <p>I started training with Stu because I wanted to improve as a triathlete and avoid injury by focusing on strength alongside my swimming, running and cycling. I've definitely achieved that, but I've also discovered a new love for moving heavy things around in the gym for its own sake! I recommend it to anyone, whether you're looking to improve at a sport or whether you'd just like to be stronger and healthier for everyday life.”</p>

          <p>“Stuart is one of the most knowledgeable, dedicated and down-right nicest personal trainers you could ever meet! I have been lucky to work with him for many years now. He has greatly helped me counterbalance the negative impact of sitting down all day, chained to my desk, by making health and fitness integral to my life.

          No matter what your age or fitness ability, I would highly recommend Stuart to provide a challenging, thoughtful and enjoyable program.”</p>
